# allert-g
An allergy group alert application to help users stay informed of allergies and restrictions of members other group members.

The development of this mobile application is brought on by personal family members having multiple allergies. Given such a large extended family, it became difficult to keep track of the multiple food restrictions and allergies affecting them.  By having a mobile application with this information, I hope to alleviate and safely keep members informed of allergies within a party.

This application is my first attempt to create a mobile application with the use of React-Native, Redux, Expo, and many other packages.

To Run Application:

* Clone and ```npm install``` the Allert-G-Backend API 
* Clone and ```npm install``` this repository. 
* Inside the file components/Constants.js 

```
export const BASE_URL = 'http://172.20.4.235:5000/api'
```
* Change the ip address to the network your system is on. 
* Install Expo.io and 
``` npm start```
to open the expo developer tools to run.
